Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

The command line enables a user to instruct their computer using text. Without needing to click into any menus, select any options, you're able to control your computer with text only commands. 

List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

1. cd - This changes your directory and is very helpful when you're wanting to carry out an action within a particular folder (directory).

2. pwd - Better known as Print Working Directory. This command will display your current directory and is very helpful if you ever forget where you're currently working within the command line.

3. ls - Prints all files within your current directory. This command is great when you're wanting to see what is within your working directory. The difference between this and pwd is that pwd only shows the location you are at, whereas ls displays what is within your current location. 

4. exit - exits the command line. Easier and faster than clicking on the 'x' icon. 

5. mkdir - a fancy way to create a new folder using the command line

6. touch - creates a new file with the filename and extension you provide

7. rm (filename) - deletes the file with the name you specify. This can also take the -R option (for folders) to remove everything within the folder.

8. clear - clears the terminal screen so you can have a fresh start and empty mind

9. code . - this command opens up the directory within Visual Studio Code and is very helpful when working through the command line - save you having to find the file using the GUI and then flipping back and forward between GUI and command line.

10. cp [file] [newfile] - allows the user to copy the current file to a new location. I mostly use this if I want to backup an important file to dropbox so there's an online backup if I'm working locally. With GitHub, I will likely use this in a different manner.
